<h1>The Spirit of Lafayette</h1>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> years after the signing of the
Declaration of Independence a hostile
Mohawk chief met in council a representative
of the young American republics for
the purpose of concluding a treaty of
peace. The representative of young democracy
was a soldier of France, the Marquis
de Lafayette. Primitive America on the
one hand, ancient Europe on the other!
"Father," said the Indian, "we have heard
thy voice and we rejoice that thou hast
visited thy children to give to them good
and necessary advice. Thou hast said
that we have done wrong in opening our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
ears to wicked men, and closing our hearts
to thy counsels. Father, it is all true; we
have left the good path; we have wandered
away from it and have been enveloped in a
black cloud. We have now returned that
thou mayest find in us good and faithful
children. We rejoice to hear thy voice
among us. It seems that the Great Spirit
has directed thy footsteps to this council
of friendship to smoke the calumet of
peace and fellowship with thy long-lost
children."</p>

<p>The Indian warrior's vision was true in
a greater sense than he knew. Through
him the soul of America spoke to the soul
of Europe, and it spoke of the fellowship of
man. Perhaps the footsteps of this soldier
of France were indeed directed by a high
Providence. Perhaps he was himself a
message from the infinite. I love, for my
own part, to believe that at his birth there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
appeared in this world an eternal and
mighty spirit, a spirit perhaps from another
age or sphere. Who knows? Why not?
Who is there can look into the great unknown,
the vast and impenetrable depths
of the heavens, and say that this could not
be, and was not so? How else explain this
child of a French monarchy, brought up
among the titled nobility of France, who
amidst such conditions grew to manhood&mdash;the
devotee of freedom and the ever-loyal
champion of democracy?</p>

<p>Lafayette was born on September 6,
1757, at the Ch&acirc;teau de Chavagnac in the
province of Auvergne in the monarchy of
France. Two months before his birth his
father was killed in battle. Left to the
sole guidance of an indulgent mother, surrounded
by flattering attendants and the
enervating influences of wealth and noble
birth, he faced the empty and useless life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of a mere titled, wealthy aristocrat. What
saved him? To add to these inauspicious
beginnings, he was, at the age of twelve,
sent to Paris to the College du Plessis
where his rank and wealth introduced him
to all the gaieties and dissipations of exclusive
fashionable Parisian society. His
mother died when he was but thirteen,
leaving him in the full possession of large
and valuable estates, the absolute master
of his own destiny, and subject to the indulgences
and corruptions of one of the
most notorious courts of all Europe. Of a
winning personality, he was appointed one
of the King's pages, a position much
coveted by the princes and nobles of the
kingdom. He was also enrolled in the
King's Regiment of Mousquetaires, and
at the age of fifteen through the favour of
the Queen obtained a commission, an
honour conferred as a mark of especial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
royal regard. He was married at the age
of sixteen, and his young wife was a daughter
of the aristocratic house of Noailles,
one of the most powerful and influential
families of the French court. What more
profoundly barren soil could be chosen to
produce the self-denying fighter for liberty,
the clean-minded democrat, Lafayette?</p>

<p>A significant incident is told of his
early life. Shortly after his marriage, his
wife's family sought for him an honorary
position in the household of the Count
de Proven&ccedil;e, afterward Louis XVIII
King of France. Lafayette did not wish
the appointment. The spirit of Lafayette,
the democrat, was already restive under
royal authority. To prevent the honour
being thrust upon him, and in order at the
same time not to offend his family by refusing
to accept, he sought an opportunity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to make himself so obnoxious to the Count
that the arrangement could not go through.
The chance offered itself at a masked ball
where the Count appeared in a disguise
which was instantly penetrated by Lafayette.
Making himself known, he lost
no time in engaging in conversation the
royal personage, who thought himself unknown,
and with a freedom and boldness
bordering upon discourtesy, he gave voice
to facts and opinions which he knew would
be obnoxious to his listener's ear. The
future King of France had little hesitation
in making up his mind that the young
Marquis would be a refractory attach&eacute;,
and declined to make the requested appointment.</p>

<p>Providence, or his own spirit, had saved
Lafayette for democracy.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1775 in the new western hemisphere
democracy was born to the modern world.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By the rude bridge that arched the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Across the vast Atlantic rolled its echoes.
Across a trackless sea, across the lands of
France, up through the great White Ways
of Paris it resounded. It knocked against
the palace doors of the King of France.
On through the flippant gibe, the careless
laugh, the carousing and the din of the
royal court, it reached and touched the
spirit of Lafayette.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>What was the strange tale that came to
him from the New World? Was it a tale
of liberty triumphant and conquering, a
tale of success, a tale to touch the imagination
of a soldier through the glory of a
winning cause? Far from it. After a
brief temporary success in Massachusetts
the cause of the newly-born confederated
American republics seemed to be tottering
upon the brink of total destruction. The
rout of the Americans at Brooklyn and
the consequent abandonment of Long
Island was followed by their evacuation of
New York City. The American army was
becoming demoralized. The militia were
impatient to return home, were disobedient
to orders, and were deserting in large
numbers&mdash;it is said "by half and even by
whole regiments." Then followed the
Americans' defeat at White Plains, the
surrender of Fort Washington, the evacuation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of Fort Lee, and the steady disheartening
of the American forces. The ineffectual
attempts to increase the militia, the
indisposition of the inhabitants to farther
resistance, the retreat of General Washington
through New Jersey at the head of less
than three thousand men, poorly armed,
almost without tents, blankets, or provisions,
discouraged by constant reverses,
many of them half-clad and barefooted in
the cold of November and December,
passing through a desponding country and
pursued by a numerous, well-appointed,
and victorious army&mdash;all these events
made liberty at this time indeed</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A wretched soul bruised with adversity."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was at this stage of the conflict that
Lafayette determined to cross the Atlantic
and take up the cause of the thirteen little
republics. Benjamin Franklin, one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
America's two representatives in France,
who at first had welcomed this offer of
assistance, upon learning of the continued
American reverses, and almost despairing
of the success of the cause, is reported
honourably to have endeavoured to dissuade
the Marquis from carrying his design
into execution. Franklin and Silas Deane,
the other American representative in
France, told him they were unable to obtain
a vessel for his passage. France was
then at peace, and the King of France forbade
his departure. Under the laws of
France he risked the confiscation of all his
property, as well as capture on the high
seas. There was no winning cause to lure
him, merely thirteen little newly-born republics
struggling for a principle, fighting
for democracy&mdash;a weak, bedraggled, and
dispirited democracy, a democracy half-clad
and poverty stricken, a barefooted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
half-naked democracy that was very
nearly down and out.</p>

<p>"Now," he replied to Franklin and
Deane, "is precisely the moment to serve
your cause; the more people are discouraged,
the greater utility will result from
my departure; and if you cannot furnish
me with a vessel, I shall charter one at my
own expense to convey your despatches
and my person to the shores of America."</p>

<p>In a Paris paper of that year, there
appears the following item:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Paris, April 4, 1777.</p>

<p>One of the richest of our young nobility, the
Marquis de Lafayette, a relation of the Duke de
Noailles, between nineteen and twenty years of
age, has at his own expense hired a vessel and
provided everything necessary for a voyage to
America, with two officers of his acquaintance. He
set out last week, having told his lady and family
that he was going to Italy. He is to serve as
Major-General in the American army.</p></div>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Lafayette</span> arrived in America in June,
1777, and at once plunged into the struggle.
He refused an active command at first,
preferring to serve in a more humble
capacity until accustomed to American
troops. In the Battle of Brandywine,
only some forty days after his arrival, he
received a wound from a musket ball&mdash;a
wound sufficient to keep him in bed for
six weeks. This battle was a defeat for the
American forces and was followed by the
fall of the City of Philadelphia. Wounds
and defeat seem, however, to have acted
only as a stimulus, and in December, 1777,
as a reward for intrepid and brilliant service,
he was given the command of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
division of the American army. He was
then twenty years of age.</p>

<p>Then followed four years of active
service under General Washington, broken
only by a temporary return to France in
1779 on a diplomatic mission. Gentle
and courteous, yet apparently insensible
to fear, his spirit was an inspiration. At
the Battle of Monmouth the enemy, during
a lull, observed a general officer in the
service of the Americans advancing into
the danger zone, with some other officers
and men, to reconnoitre the enemy's
position. An aide-de-camp fell, struck
by a ball, and all but the general fled
precipitately. They saw the latter, although
under the fire of a battery, lean
to assist the stricken aide, and finding that
all was ended turn and slowly rejoin the
others. The British commander, General
Clinton, ordered his men not to fire; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the chivalry of this Englishman probably
saved the American officer's life. It
was Lafayette.</p>

<p>In 1780 he asked leave to take a position
in the Southern Department where the
situation of the American army is described
in a letter to Lafayette by General
Greene, then commanding the division.</p>

<p>"It is now within a few days of the time
when you shall be with me. Were you
to arrive you would find a few ragged, half-starved
troops in the wilderness, destitute
of everything necessary for either the comfort
or convenience of soldiers....
The country is almost laid waste and the
inhabitants plunder one another with little
less than savage fury. We live from hand
to mouth, and have nothing to subsist
on but what we collect with armed parties....
I fear this department is to be
the great Serbonian bog to the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
armies and particularly to the general
officers."</p>

<p>The vision of a Serbonian bog acted
only as a magnet, and Lafayette started
to join Greene. On his way, however, he
was recalled by the commander-in-chief,
General Washington, to take command
of an expedition against Benedict Arnold,
the traitor, now a brigadier-general in the
enemy's army, who was marching into
Virginia and with revengeful fury carrying
fire and sword wherever he went. Lafayette
was dispatched against him with
specific orders that if Arnold surrendered
there should be no stipulation made for
his safety, and at the same time forbidding
the slightest injury to his person;&mdash;it being
the purpose of Washington, never however
fulfilled, to bring Arnold to public
punishment according to the rules and
regulations of the army.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Lafayette's command seems to have
been no better than Greene's. In a letter
to Greene he describes his men as being in
a condition of "shocking nakedness."
Even the officers were destitute of money,
clothing, and everything that could contribute
to cleanliness and comfort. As
for the men, they were poorly fed, their
shoes worn out, without tents, and destitute
of almost any protection from the
inclemency of the weather. Some of his
officers assured the Marquis that his command
would speedily be reduced one-half
by desertion,&mdash;and as a matter of fact
thirteen out of one company deserted in a
single day. A nauseous and contagious
disease, generally produced by a want of
cleanliness, overspread nearly the entire
command. In consequence of these difficulties,
Arnold escaped, but Lafayette
forced his retreat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The military genius of George Washington
at last turned the tide of war. In
October, 1781, he had the enemy's troops
under Cornwallis cornered at Yorktown.
In the course of the siege it became necessary
to capture a certain redoubt possessed
by the enemy. Washington determined to
carry it with the bayonet, and appointed
Lafayette to conduct the charge. The
American infantry advanced with irresistible
power, relying entirely upon their
bayonets, and carried the redoubt by
assault.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward Cornwallis surrendered
his entire army to Washington, and the
last battle of the American Revolution
had been fought. In November, 1781,
the confederated republics having won,
Lafayette returned to France.</p>

<p>Washington and Lafayette! The American
and the Frenchman. Great soldiers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
both, but above all, great <i>men</i>. The real
soul of the soldier speaks out in this letter
from the American to the Frenchman,
written in 1784: "At length, my dear Marquis,
I have become a private citizen on
the banks of the Potomac; and under the
shadow of my own vine and my own fig-tree,
free from the bustle of the camp and
the busy scenes of public life, I am solacing
myself with those tranquil enjoyments,
of which the soldier who is ever in pursuit
of fame, the statesman whose watchful
days and sleepless nights are spent in
devising schemes to promote the welfare
of his own, perhaps the ruin of other
countries, as if this globe was insufficient
for us all&mdash;and the courtier who is always
watching the countenance of his prince in
the hope of catching a gracious smile&mdash;can
have very little conception. I have not
only retired from all public employments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
but am retiring within myself and shall
be able to view the solitary walk, and tread
the paths of private life with heartfelt
satisfaction. Envious of none, I am determined
to be pleased with all; and this,
my dear friend, being the order of my
march, I shall move gently down the stream
of life until I sleep with my fathers."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> scene in the world-wide drama of
democracy shifts across the Atlantic Ocean,
from America to France. The French
Revolution of 1789 and the Reign of
Terror&mdash;a century's pent-up rage against
despotism, let loose in a single hour!</p>

<p>When Madame Roland was summoned
before the revolutionary tribunal she came
with a smile upon her lips, her face sparkling
with life and animation. Condemned
in advance, she was falsely declared guilty
of being the author of a "mutinous conspiracy
against the unity and defense of
the republic." She heard her sentence
calmly. "You deem me worthy the fate
of the great men you have murdered. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
shall try to display the same courage on
the scaffold." She was at once taken in a
cart to the Place de la Revolution, a man
guilty of treason being placed in the same
cart. He was overwhelmed with terror
and she occupied her time in soothing him.
On reaching the guillotine, she bade him
mount the steps first, that his sufferings
might not be prolonged. As she took her
place, her eyes fell on a colossal statue of
Liberty, recently erected near by. "O
Liberty," she cried, "what crimes are
committed in thy name!"</p>

<p>"There is no God." Thus in 1793, by
solemn enactment of the Terrorists, was
the Deity legislated out of existence.
There is no God! What sayest thou now,
Robespierre? Dost thou say so, <i>now</i>?
How likedst thou thy brief space of usurpation?
A few brief months of power&mdash;night
and day with loaded pistols at thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
side&mdash;no food till some one else had tasted
from thy dish, lest it be poisoned. And
then another scene in that same legislative
hall, the hall of thy own great terrifying
power. A vote ordering thy arrest! Vain
are thy shrieks&mdash;a detachment of thy own
soldiers forces its way into the room&mdash;a
pistol shot rings out, and thou with shattered
jaw, a ghastly spectacle, facest thy
end. Thou fallest, and some spit upon
thy prostrate form, others stab thee with
their knives. Still living, thy body is
hurried before the tribunal thou thyself
didst form, and thence to the guillotine.
O Robespierre, thinkest thou now there is
a God?</p>

<p>License, not liberty. Mania, not reason.
How fared the spirit of Lafayette during
this debauchery in the name of freedom?</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A brief</span> interval of less than ten years
intervened between the closing scenes of
the American Revolution and the opening
scenes of the French Revolution. Democracy
in America was a victor, and the
republic had been established. Democracy
in France was just entering upon its
cyclonic and hideous struggle for the right
to live.</p>

<p>The government of France was at that
time an absolute despotism. The king
was the supreme arbiter of its destinies.
He was the head of the army. He appointed
his own ministers, made his own
laws, levied and raised taxes at his pleasure,
and lavished his treasures as he pleased.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
The common people were more like cattle
than men. They tilled the ground and
bore the yoke; the king and the aristocracy
wielded the whip. Years of suffering
ignorance for the many&mdash;years of
riotous profligacy for the few!</p>

<p>True democracy is world-wide. It
knows no nationality. All mankind are
its countrymen. When at the close of
the American war Lafayette returned to
France, he hung in his house a copy of
the American Declaration of Independence
upon one of the walls, leaving the corresponding
space on the opposite side vacant.
"What do you mean to place here?" asked
one of his friends. "A Declaration of
Rights for France," he replied.</p>

<p>Frederick the Great, King of Prussia,
the first giant of the Hohenzollerns and the
fountain head of modern Prussian autocracy,
attracted by Lafayette's military reputation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
invited him to the royal palace at Potsdam
to witness and take part in the review
of the Prussian army. At dinner one evening
Frederick declared confidently his
opinion that America would not long be a
republic, but would return to the good old
system. "Never, sir," replied his guest.
"A monarchy, a nobility can never exist
in America." "Sir," said the monarch,
"I knew a young man who, after having
visited countries where liberty and equality
reigned, conceived the idea of establishing
the same system in his own country. Do
you know what happened to him?" "No,
sir." "He was hanged," replied the King
with a smile.</p>

<p>In 1789 the mutterings of the coming
storm became more ominous, but the
King of France, deafened by the clamour
of cackling advice from his aristocracy,
either could not or would not hear. Almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
bankrupt because of the extravagance
of the court, he needed money, still more
money, and called an "assembly of notables"
to assist in devising measures to
relieve his embarrassed finances. They
were men from the most distinguished of
the nobility. Lafayette was one. In a
letter to Washington he humorously remarked
that "wicked people called them
not-ables." Lafayette's part in the assembly
consisted in making a bold protest
against the prodigality of the crown.
"All the millions given up to cupidity or
depredation," he forcefully exclaimed to
the noble gathering, "are the fruit of the
sweat, the tears, and perhaps the blood, of
the nation"; and he concluded by requesting
that the King convoke a real National
Assembly, made up of representatives of
the common people. It was the beginning
of the Revolution. For Lafayette's part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in this the King's prime minister, Calonne,
proposed to the monarch to send Lafayette
to the Bastile.</p>

<p>Nothing was accomplished by the notables,
and the monarch then decided to
assemble the states-general. This was
not a legislative body, but an assembly
of representatives from the nobility, the
clergy, and the common people, sometimes
called by the crown when it needed assistance,
the commons always being in the
minority. The commons, <i>le tiers &eacute;tat</i>
grasped the opportunity, met by themselves,
and on June 17, 1789, resolved
themselves into a National Assembly, to
accomplish the regeneration of France.</p>

<p>Troops were summoned by the crown
to put down the rebellion, and more than
fifty thousand mercenary troops from
foreign states were engaged by the King
to take the place of the French troops,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
whom he distrusted. Lafayette joined
with the National Assembly, and then
and there proposed to it the first draft
of that French Declaration of Rights for
which he had prophetically left a space on
the wall of his home. The essence of his
draft lies in the following extract: "No
man can be subject to any laws, excepting
those which have received the assent of
himself or his representatives, and which
are promulgated beforehand and applied
legally. The principle of all sovereignty
resides in the nation."</p>

<p>On July 14, 1789, the storm broke.
The gigantic fortress of the Bastile which
for ages had reared its menacing head
among the people of Paris, a terrible
engine of despotic military autocracy,
was attacked and taken by the mob. M.
De Launay, its Governor, was killed by a
bayonet thrust, and his head cut from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
body and carried through the streets upon
a pitchfork. "And in this bloody manner,
into those dungeons where thousands
had wasted away, often without trial and
with no knowledge of the charges against
them, liberty sent her first ray of sunlight."</p>

<p>"When oppression renders a revolution
necessary, insurrection becomes the holiest
of duties," was the ringing message of
Lafayette to the Assembly. The key of
the Bastile was given to him as the representative
of freedom in Europe, and together
with a sketch of the ruins of that
fortress of despotism, he sent it to George
Washington. "It is a tribute," he wrote,
"which I owe, as a son to my adopted
father&mdash;as an aide-de-camp to my general&mdash;as
a missionary of liberty to its patriarch."</p>

<p>A National Guard, a new army of two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
hundred thousand citizen soldiers, was
authorized and formed by the National
Assembly, both for the protection of the
rights of the people at home and for resistance
to possible foreign aggression. Lafayette,
now thirty-two years of age, was
chosen its commander-in-chief. Thus was
born democracy in France.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A foreign</span> peasant, from a land of
despotic autocracy, who had just immigrated
to the United States, was once
haled into one of our police courts, charged
with almost murdering his wife with a
club. His defense was that he now was in
a land of liberty and he thought he could
do what he liked. Multiply this by a
million-fold and you have the Reign of
Terror, the second chapter of the French
Revolution.</p>

<p>"<i>Aimez les amis du peuple et l'enthousiasme
pour la libert&eacute;, mais r&eacute;servez l'aveugle
soumission pour la loi</i>," said Lafayette
to the Federation of National Guards.
The atrocities, both at the storming of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Bastile and afterward, he would not
countenance, and on more than one occasion,
at the head of his armed troops, he
enforced law and order. Finally, Austria
and Prussia declared war upon France,
and Lafayette was sent from Paris and at
the head of a French army of twenty-eight
thousand men was stationed at Sedan.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that he and the Jacobins,
the leaders in the mad orgy of debauched
democracy that succeeded the
initial stages of the revolution, should soon
split. For a long time the Jacobins had
seemed to shrink from a contest with him,
probably because they hoped to win him
over to their excesses. Finding him inflexible,
when at last they controlled the
government, they vowed his destruction,
and he was deprived of his command.
They proposed that a price should be set
upon his head and that "<i>chaque citoyen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
p&ucirc;t courir sus</i>"&mdash;that is to say, that any
one who pleased might murder him.</p>

<p>Deprived of his command, and with
destruction awaiting him in the rear, his
only resource was flight. Even then he
hesitated, but reason prevailed and on a
dark and rainy night, with a few companions
on horseback, he started for Holland.
To get there he had to pass through territory
occupied by the Austrian and Prussian
troops. Facing the almost certain chance
of falling in with a superior force, he determined
to make a bold front, and went
directly to the Austrian commander at
Namur, declaring that he was a French
officer attached to constitutional measures
and seeking an asylum in Holland. Instead
of being given a passport, he was,
when recognized, detained, given over to
a Prussian commander, sent in a cart to
Wesel on the Rhine and there put in a cell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in irons. It was then intimated to him
that the burden of the situation would be
lightened if he would draw up certain plans
to be used against France. The Prussians,
finding that he would not do this, instead of
treating him as a prisoner of war threw
him into a dungeon at Magdebourg. His
estate at home was confiscated and his wife
imprisoned. After a year's imprisonment
at Magdebourg in a dirty and humid vault
he was transferred by the Prussians from
one dungeon to another, and at last confined
in the Austrian citadel of Olmutz.</p>

<p>The walls of his dungeon at Olmutz were
six feet thick and the air was admitted
through openings two feet square secured
at each end by massive iron bars. Before
these loopholes was situated a broad ditch,
which was filled with water only when it
rained; at other times it was a stagnant
marsh continually emitting disease; beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
this were the outer walls of the castle, so
that the slightest breeze could never refresh
the inmate. Each cell had two doors, one
of iron, the other of wood nearly two feet
thick, and both were covered with bolts,
bars, and padlocks. When the soldiers
twice a day brought the prisoner's wretched
portion it was carefully examined to find
out if there was any note or communication
contained in it. A messy bed of rotten
straw filled with vermin, together with a
broken chair and an old worm-eaten table,
formed the whole furniture of his establishment.
The cell was from eight to ten
paces long and six wide; in storms the
water frequently flowed through the loopholes;
when the sun did not shine he remained
almost in darkness during the
whole day.</p>

<p>He was a prisoner of war and entitled to
be treated as such. But instead he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
confined in a dungeon and was given to
believe that he would never again see beyond
its four walls, that he would never
receive news of any events or persons, that
his name would be unknown in the citadel,
and that in all accounts of him sent to
Court he would be designated only by a
number. Even knives and forks were
denied him, and he was told that this was
done because his situation was such as
naturally to lead to suicide. His sufferings
proved almost beyond his strength. The
want of air and decent food, and the loathsome
dampness of his dungeon brought him
more than once to the borders of the grave.
His frame was wasted by diseases, and
on one occasion he was so reduced that "his
hair fell from him entirely by the excess of
his sufferings."</p>

<p>Following a bold attempt to escape,
the torture of his imprisonment was increased.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Irons were securely fastened
around his ankles. During the winter of
1794-1795, which was extremely severe, he
had a violent fever and almost died; he was
deprived of proper attendance, of air, of
suitable food, and of decent clothes; in
this state he had nothing for his bed but a
little damp and mouldy straw; around
his waist was a chain which was fastened
to the wall and barely permitted him to
turn from one side to the other. No light
was admitted into his cell. To increase
his miseries, almost insupportable mental
anguish was added to his physical suffering.
He was made to believe that he was only
saved for a public execution, while at the
same time he was not permitted to know
whether his family were still alive or had
perished under the axe during the Reign
of Terror.</p>

<p>A Prussian statesman to whom in 1793<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a memorial had been addressed soliciting
Lafayette's release is said to have replied:
"Lafayette has too much fanaticism for
liberty. He does not conceal it. All his
letters prove it. If he were out of prison
he could not remain quiet. I saw him
when he was here and I shall always recollect
one of his expressions, which surprised
me very much at the time: 'Do you
believe,' said he, 'that I went to America
to obtain military reputation?&mdash;it was for
liberty I went there. He who loves liberty
can only remain quiet after having established
it in his own country.'"</p>

<p>O liberty, hard is thy path! License
wearing thy mask at home, and thy champion
betrayed to the dungeon of thy eternal
foe!</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Out</span> of the chaos rose the dictator.
Napoleon's comet was beginning to ascend.</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte in 1797 was commander
in Italy of the victorious army of
the French Republic, and as such he demanded
of Austria that the French prisoners
in the fortress of Olmutz be set at liberty.
Consent was given as to the others, but
only after much talk and grudgingly as to
Lafayette. His unconquerable hostility
to the reigning autocracies was too well
known, and Austria even attempted to
impose the terms that, if freed, Lafayette
should be deported to America under
promise never again to put his foot either
in Austria or Prussia. But Lafayette<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
himself would not consent to be freed on
these terms, and Napoleon insisted; so,
finally, at the dictation of Napoleon Bonaparte,
on September 19, 1797, after more
than five years' imprisonment, Lafayette's
fetters were knocked off and he was released.
Napoleon afterward often alluded
to the intense hatred of the monarchs
and royal cabinets of Europe for the
democrat Lafayette. "I am sufficiently
hated," said he one day to Lafayette,
"by the princes and their courtiers; but
it is nothing to their hatred for you. I
have been so situated as to see it, and I
could not have believed that human hate
could go so far."</p>

<p>Perhaps at no time was the spirit of
Lafayette put to a greater test than in the
years that followed&mdash;the years of the
rise of imperial Napoleon, Emperor of the
French.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Revenge against his prison keepers, the
certainty of high success, the excitement
of a great popular cause, military glory,
gratitude to his deliverer, all co&ouml;rdinated
to make him follow the path of conquest,
and lead with Napoleon. He could have
been one of the great military heroes of
those times. But apparently these temptations
rebounded from him as an arrow
from a steel plate. When only a boy of
seventeen, his noble relatives had been
unable to conceive his refusing an honorable
place in royalty's household. It had
been inconceivable to the Prussian that
this Frenchman had not gone to America
on a quest solely for military glory. The
Jacobin clubs, first by fair promises and
then by the demand for his life blood, had
sought to force him from liberty to license,
from real freedom to debauched freedom.
But like Sir Galahad, the Knight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Holy Grail, he had stood true to his quest,
true to his ideal, true to the inward light
that unerringly marked the real from the
false, true to genuine democracy in its fight
against autocracy. And now, greater than
all these lures and tests, stood before him
Napoleon Bonaparte, his deliverer, the
greatest military captain of the world
beckoning him to paths of fame. The
sceptre of all that the professional soldier
held dear was thrust into his hands.
He could not be false unto himself, and
the sceptre was turned aside.</p>

<p>When he found that Napoleon was
plotting against the democracy of France,
that a new imperial power was rising in
Napoleon's person, he deliberately broke
off his relations with the general. During
the days of the French conquests under
Napoleon he lived the life of a quiet
country gentleman, interested solely in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
domestic life, agriculture, and the pursuit
of reading and science. The man who
had staked his all in a desperate chance in
the war of democracy against despotic
autocracy would not raise his finger in a
war of conquest for the aggrandizement
of an emperor, though driven by the demon
of revenge, drawn by the ties of gratitude,
and enticed by the lure of glory.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On March</span> 1, 1815, Napoleon returned
from Elba and began the final act in the
great drama of his life. In a last effort to
win Lafayette to his side, he sent his
brother Joseph Bonaparte on a special
mission to Lafayette with word that the
latter's name was placed first upon Napoleon's
list of peers. Joseph returned with
a refusal. "Should I ever again appear
upon the sea of public life," Lafayette
had replied, "it will only be as a representative
of the people."</p>

<p>Waterloo!&mdash;and Napoleon disappeared
forever from the world drama. Then
came back the Bourbons, first Louis
XVIII, followed by Charles X. Step by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
step, under the Bourbon <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, autocracy
began to regain its grip upon France.
The year 1830 opened ominously. The
rumblings of 1789 were again heard. The
French Chamber of Deputies protested
against the growing usurpations of the
crown. The King boldly defied them,
dissolved the Chamber, annulled the electoral
laws then in force, reduced the
number of deputies nearly one-half, and
materially changed the conditions of suffrage
and representation.</p>

<p>Lafayette was at his country estate,
La Grange, when the <i>Moniteur</i> with a
copy of these decrees reached him. He
immediately set out for Paris. Revolt had
already commenced, and war was raging in
the streets of the city. The revolutionists
wanted a leader and all eyes turned to
Lafayette. He was called by acclamation
to command the National Guard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>He was now seventy-two years of age,
but he accepted the call. Immediately
he established his headquarters in Paris
and passed the whole night inspecting
barriers and preparing for a renewal of the
battle on the morrow. At dawn it began
again and the National Guard under
Lafayette drove back the royal troops and
carried all before them. On July 29, 1830,
the Chamber of Deputies reassembled,
organized a provisional government, and
formally invested Lafayette with the powers
of military dictator of France. "Liberty
shall triumph," he replied in his
letter of acceptance, "or we will perish
together."</p>

<p>Charles X, seeing the hopelessness of
the royal cause, sent a deputation to Lafayette
to announce the revocation of the
obnoxious decrees and the nomination of
a new and liberal ministry. "It is too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
late," Lafayette sent word back, "all
conciliation is impossible. The royal family
has ceased to reign." Thus ended the
dynasty of the elder branch of the Bourbons
on the throne of France. The deposed
king was allowed to pass unmolested to
another country.</p>

<p>The people who had accomplished the
revolution, especially the citizen army,
loudly demanded a republic with Lafayette
for its president. Others begged him to
mount the throne himself. But to all
these entreaties he turned a deaf ear.
He thought not of himself but of France
alone.</p>

<p>A constitutional monarchy, under Louis
Phillippe, followed. It was successful at
first, until the old, old story of attempted
autocratic usurpation was again repeated
by the monarch. He was forcibly ejected,
and the Republic of 1848 was formed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
But long ere this, moving gently down the
stream of life, the journey had ended,
and Lafayette slept with his fathers.

<p>Lafayette symbolized two great principles
of government. First, the right of a
people to govern themselves, as opposed to
government of the many by a self-appointed
few&mdash;in other words, democracy as opposed
to autocracy. Second, a union of
the democracies to insure mutual protection
and peace.</p>

<p>When only a boy at school, he was told
in class one day to describe a perfect
courser, and he sacrificed his hope of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
obtaining a premium by describing a horse
which on perceiving the whip threw down
his master. He adopted on his arms the
device, "<i>Cur non?</i>"&mdash;"Why not?" Before
landing in America in 1777 he wrote
to his wife: "I but offer my services to
that interesting republic from motives of
the purest kind, unmixed with ambition or
private views: her happiness and my glory
are my only incentives to the task. I hope
that, for my sake, you will be a good American,
for that feeling is worthy of every
noble heart. The happiness of America
is intimately connected with the happiness
of all mankind; she will become the safe
and respected asylum of virtue, integrity,
toleration, equality, and tranquil happiness."</p>

<p>In camp at Valley Forge, January, 1778,
he writes to his wife, who was then seeking
his return: "The desire ... to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
promote ... the happiness of humanity
which is strongly interested in the
existence of one perfectly free nation
... forbids my departure."</p>

<p>Upon a return visit to America in 1784,
speaking to a deputation from the Pennsylvania
Legislature, he said: "Now that
the great work is accomplished let us
mutually congratulate ourselves on the
federal union which this peace has cemented,
and upon which the importance,
the power, and the riches of this beautiful
country rest; that union is the bond which
will continue to preserve brotherly love
and reciprocal friendship among the citizens
of the states. I shall be happy to
receive the command of this Republic
at every period of my existence and in
whatever part of the world I may be; my
zeal for its prosperity is only equalled by
my gratitude and respect." A statement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
from his reply to a special committee
appointed by Congress to wait upon him
shows the same feeling: "May this immense
temple of freedom ever stand a
lesson to oppressors, an example to the
oppressed, and a sanctuary for the rights of
mankind."</p>

<p>The confederation in 1776 of the thirteen
separate colonies of the western world
was a union of all the then existing democracies
of a hemisphere, to insure mutual
protection and peace. Since then, democracy
has been born in the Old World. In
its common cause it knows no nationality.
Lafayette is the symbol of its internationalism.
In the time of our greatest stress he
crossed the ocean to us, saying: "Now is
precisely the moment to serve your cause."
To-day democracy in France is bleeding to
death. Throughout Europe, assailed in
front by the giant of Prussian militarism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and stabbed in the back by assassins conducting
an insidious and treacherous peace
propaganda, it is staggering under the combined
attack. The spirit of Lafayette, the
democrat, calls to us across that same
ocean. The bugles of the heavens ring out.
The days of '76 are born again. Once
more is heard the battle-cry of the Republic.
Where his spirit calls, our armies
go. And when the great work is accomplished,
we shall cement the union which
he began.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> is democracy worth preserving?
How fares that intangible something which
was the inspiration of this man's living?
Democracy, the right of people to govern
themselves, as opposed to their control by
a self-appointed few&mdash;is it a failure or a
success? Has it proved itself worth the
dedication of this soldier spirit?</p>

<p>The French, for themselves, have answered
the question at the Battle of the
Marne and at Verdun. But how about
America? Has the great American democracy
proved a success, as compared
with government by autocracy&mdash;for
example, as compared with the government
of Germany by the Prussian military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
autocracy, headed by the House of
Hohenzollern?</p>

<p>More than a century has passed since
the surrender of Cornwallis. Since then
in physical growth and material success
the democracy of the United States has
more than fulfilled the highest hopes. At
that time these United States were only a
strip along the eastern seaboard, bounded
on the east by the Atlantic Ocean and on
the west by an unexplored wilderness;
thirteen sparsely settled states, the settlements
widely separated from each other,
with a population of less than four million
persons. Now the wilderness is overcome.
By the Louisiana Purchase we acquired
the Great Southwest. For a pittance we
bought the wastes of Alaska and then found
them to be the gold fields of the world.
The Philippines, with an area of one hundred
and fifteen thousand square miles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and the Hawaiian Islands mark the extension
of our western boundaries. Cuba
is under our immediate protection. Porto
Rico is part of us, and likewise the Danish
West Indies. In Central America we have
built the Panama Canal. By the Monroe
Doctrine we are the protectors from foreign
interference of all of Central and South
America. Our population has grown to
more than one hundred million souls.
Our material wealth is the greatest of any
single nation in the world.</p>

<p>Does this constitute success? Look on
the other side of the picture. Our form of
national government has been notoriously
inefficient&mdash;taking Germany as the standard.
Our state governments at their best
are mediocre, while at their worst they stand
pitifully paralyzed before mob law. Our unpunished
lynchings of coloured people, innocent
as well as guilty, make us contemptible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in the eyes of the civilized world. No
other government on earth remains silent
and helpless while its citizens assemble as
for a holiday and burn a criminal at the
stake. Our municipalities are largely
rotten with graft, and the graft is accompanied
by its inevitable handmaids, extravagance
and inefficiency. Enormous
wealth, in the hands of a few, dwells side
by side with extreme poverty. Our cities
are overcrowded, and the country of
Whittier, where</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shut in from all the world without<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sat the clean-winged hearth about,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">is handed over to the huts and shanties of
immigrants. Capital fights labour and labour
fights capital. Politics are such that
most men avoid them. The standard of
work is not how well you can do your job,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
but how much you can make out of it. Is
this democracy a success?</p>

<p>In answer to this, however, does not an
inner consciousness in each of us, perhaps
the spirit of Lafayette and perhaps our
own, perhaps the whispering of an unseen,
great, and infinite power, tell us that the
really relevant question is not whether we
have yet achieved success, but whether a
successful democracy is worth striving for?
If, however, I should be obliged to answer
the question by "Yes" or "No" I would
say, "Yes, it is a success!"</p>

<p>The best route for the development of
any man lies along the hard and thorny
road of self-development. In the end,
self-development, by dint of hard work
and mistakes, produces the best man,
provided he has the courage to "see it
through." Nations are merely big collections
of individuals. In the end this self-development<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
produces the best nation.
The road is filled with difficulties, but so
are most roads to goals that are worth
reaching.</p>

<p>Our national government may have been
inefficient in its details, but taken as a whole
it has created a country which for generations
has been a haven for the oppressed
of the world. How many hundred thousand
Germans have immigrated to America?
How many Americans have ever emigrated
to Germany? We have lynchings in the
South, but no other country was ever left a
more hideous problem of slavery, and in
1861 when the supreme test came the government
rose to it; no one but a visionary
can expect an immediate Utopian readjustment.
Our municipalities abound in graft,
but what country before ours ever faced the
problem of absorbing annually the enormous
flood of unlettered immigrants that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
is unceasingly poured upon us by the Old
World. The wonder is not that we have
graft, but that we have not more graft.
We have great wealth and extreme poverty,
but they are due to unusual economic
causes, namely: great national resources
on the one hand, and ceaseless immigration
on the other. Our cities are overcrowded
and our standards of work are superficial,
but would this be cured by a despotism?</p>

<p>And always we have the hope that goes
with liberty, the undying strength that
accompanies the knowledge that you are
master of your own soul. A good despot
at the head of a military autocracy may
for the time being make the most efficient
government in the world; certainly a bad
despot at the head of a military autocracy
makes the worst government. But I will
never believe that the total surrender of the
individual to the guiding hand of a despotic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
autocracy makes in the end for the progress
of the whole. History shows it to be untrue;
the never-ceasing efforts of democracy,
as endless as the waves of the sea,
show that despotic autocracy cannot last;
and the hell let loose upon earth by Prussian
autocracy, its modern exponent,
clinches the falsity of its creed for all but
the intoxicated or maniacs.</p>

<p>"We Hohenzollerns take our crown from
God alone. On me the Spirit of God has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
descended. I regard my whole ...
task as appointed by heaven. Who opposes
me I shall crush to pieces. Nothing
must be settled in this world without the
intervention ... of ... the
German Emperor. He who listens to
public opinion runs a danger of inflicting
immense harm on ... the State.
When one occupies certain positions in the
world one ought to make dupes rather
than friends. Christian morality cannot
be political. Treaties are only a disguise
to conceal other political aims. Remember
that the German people are the chosen
of God.</p>

<p>"Might is right and ... is decided
by war. Every youth who enters
a beer-drinking and duelling club will
receive the true direction of his life. War
in itself is a good thing. God will see to it
that war always recurs. The efforts directed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
toward the abolition of war must
not only be termed foolish, but absolutely
immoral. The peace of Europe is only a
secondary matter for us. The sight of
suffering does one good; the infliction of
suffering does one more good. This war
must be conducted as ruthlessly as possible.</p>

<p>"The Belgians should not be shot <i>dead</i>.
They should be ... so left as to
make impossible all hope of recovery.
The troops are to treat the Belgian civil
population with unrelenting severity and
frightfulness. Weak nations have not
the same right to live as powerful ...
nations. The world has no longer need
of little nationalities. We Germans have
little esteem and less respect ... for
Holland. We need to enlarge our colonial
possessions; such territorial acquisitions
we can only realize at the cost of other
states.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Russia must no longer be our frontier.
The Polish press should be annihilated
... likewise the French and
Danish.... The Poles should be allowed
... three privileges: to pay
taxes, serve in the army, and shut their jaws.
France must be so completely crushed
that she will never again cross our path.
You must remember that we have not
come to make war on the French people,
but to bring them the higher Civilization.
The French have shown themselves decadent
and without respect for the Divine
law. Against England we fight for booty.
Our real enemy is England. We have to
... crush absolutely perfidious Albion
... subdue her to such an extent
that her influence all over the world
is broken forever.</p>

<p>"German should replace English as the
world language. English, the bastard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
tongue ... must be swept into the
remotest corners ... until it has
returned to its original elements of an insignificant
pirate dialect. The German
language acts as a blessing which, coming
direct from the hand of God, sinks into the
heart like a precious balm. To us, more
than any other nation, is intrusted the true
structure of human existence. Our own
country, by employing military power,
has attained a degree of Culture which
it could never have reached by peaceful
means.</p>

<p>"The civilization of mankind suffers
every time a German becomes an American.
Let us drop our miserable attempts
to excuse Germany's action. We willed it.
Our might shall create a new law in Europe.
It is Germany that strikes. We
are morally and intellectually superior
beyond all comparison.... We must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
... fight with Russian beasts, English
mercenaries, and Belgian fanatics.
We have nothing to apologize for. It is
no consequence whatever if all the monuments
ever created, all the pictures ever
painted, all the buildings ever erected by
the great architects of the world, be destroyed....
The ugliest stone placed
to mark the burial of a German grenadier
is a more glorious monument than all the
cathedrals of Europe put together. No
respect for the tombs of Shakespeare,
Newton, and Faraday.</p>

<p>"They call us barbarians. What of it?
The German claim must be: ... Education
to hate ... Organization of
hatred ... Education to the desire
for hatred. Let us abolish unripe and
false shame.... To us is given faith,
hope, and hatred; but hatred is the greatest
among them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The German war code, introduction,
paragraph three, reads as follows: "A war
conducted with energy cannot be directed
merely against the combatants of the enemy
state, and the positions which they occupy,
but will in like manner seek to destroy
the total intellectual and material resources
of the latter."</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We are</span> at war. On April 6, 1917,
the democracy of the United States of
America formally declared war against
the autocracy of Germany. What are
we fighting for?</p>

<p>Two brutes in the shape of men engage
in a savage, drunken brawl. Bloody,
cursing, dishevelled, with swollen and distorted
features, and screaming their anathemas
of drunken hate, they fight with
the ferocity of beasts. Beasts they are.</p>

<p>A bully, a degenerate, a thug of the
city, a brigand of the country, a horse thief
of the western plains, attacks a weaker
and unprepared victim. A man with red
blood in his veins sees the assault, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
attacks the attacker with strength enough
to save the victim, arrest the disturber of
the peace, and prevent a repetition of the
offense. He has been engaged in a fight,
but he is not a beast.</p>

<p>The spirit of Lafayette brought him to
America to fight for democracy; he was a
hard fighter but he was not a beast. And
now, against that calculating and brutal
power which with the treachery of a tiger
of the jungle and all the devilish ingenuity
of the highest Kultur has assaulted the
peace of the world, the armies of America
are led by the spirit of Lafayette.</p>

<p>For years the Prussian military autocracy
has been preparing for the leap upon
its victim. The power to declare war has
been kept solely and exclusively in the
hands of the military autocracy. It is
responsible to no one. The great mass
of people must do as they are commanded;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
obeying, not laws made by themselves
acting through their duly-elected representatives,
but orders promulgated by a
self-appointed few, the military autocracy
of Prussia. Woe to the unfortunate
victim who refuses to obey! With
cold-blooded deliberation this military
autocracy which controls the German
people has for years been preparing its
huge fighting machine. When the time to
strike came, when the neighbouring countries
were least prepared to resist, Germany
was deluged with the lie that the
German nation was attacked, the scrap
of paper otherwise called a treaty was
torn up, and the tiger sprang. The world
knows the result.</p>

<p>We enter the war for two motives, one
to preserve the democracies of Europe, the
other for our own preservation. The sinking
of our ships by submarines was merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the immediate cause, the match that lit
the fire, just as the firing on Fort Sumter
was the proximate but not the real cause
of our Civil War. The real cause of our
Civil War was, as Lincoln said, because this
nation "could not endure half slave and
half free." The real cause of the present
World War is because civilization cannot
endure half military autocracy and half
free democracy. "The world must be
made safe for democracy." We fight to
save the intended victims of Prussianism,
to arrest the disturber of the peace, and
prevent a repetition of the offense.</p>

<p>The President of the United States in
his great message, delivered in the Congress
of the United States on the second
day of April, 1917, in which he advised
the Congress to accept the status of belligerent
thrust upon us by the acts of the
Imperial Government of Germany in unlawfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sinking our ships and killing our
citizens, said: "Let us be very clear, and
make very clear to all the world what our
motives and our objects are.... Our
object ... is to vindicate the principles
of peace and justice in the life of the
world as against selfish and autocratic
power and to set up amongst the really
free and self-governed peoples of the world
such a concert of purpose and of action
as will henceforth ensure the observance
of those principles. Neutrality is no longer
feasible or desirable where the peace of the
world is involved and the freedom of its
peoples, and the menace to that peace
and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic
governments backed by organized
force which is controlled wholly by their
will, not by the will of their people....</p>

<p>"We are now about to accept gauge of
battle with this natural foe to liberty and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
shall, if necessary, spend the whole force
of the nation to check and nullify its pretensions
and its power.... The
world must be made safe for democracy.
Its peace must be planted upon the tested
foundations of political liberty. We have
no selfish ends to serve. We desire no
conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities
for ourselves, no material compensation
for the sacrifices we shall freely
make. We are but one of the champions
of the rights of mankind. We shall be
satisfied when those rights have been made
as secure as the faith and the freedom of
nations can make them."</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We are</span> at war with the Menace. It is
the same Menace&mdash;now grown to a monster
with four heads dominated by one brain&mdash;that
over a hundred years ago invited
Lafayette to its palace at Potsdam to
review the Prussian army, and then
cynically suggested to him an end upon the
scaffold. It is the same Menace, now from
its four mouths spitting its spume of hate
upon a chaotic world, that thrust the body
of the champion of democracy into a dungeon,
but could not kill his soul. Our
present war against this creature of evil is
but one more act in the drama begun by
the spirit of Lafayette.</p>

<p>How shall this act end? Listen to this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
I quote largely from Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;radame, a
man who deals not in platitudes and conceits
to tickle the vanity of a nation, but
in cold, hard facts.</p>

<p>In 1914, when the war began, Prussian
militarism controlled Germany, with a
population of sixty-eight millions; and
Germany had one ally, Austria-Hungary,
of whose thirty million people a majority
were directly antagonistic to Berlin. By
the spring of 1915 it had extended and
organized its power among these thirty
million Austro-Hungarians, who until that
time had taken orders from their own
independent military chiefs. In the fall
of 1915 it joined hands with Bulgaria and
Turkey over the corpse of Serbia. Thus,
since the beginning of the war, has been
formed the Quadruple Alliance, dominated
by Prussian militarism.</p>

<p>This alliance, or Prussia before the alliance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
was completed, has since the beginning
of the war seized Belgium, Poland, Serbia,
Albania, Montenegro, part of France, and
most of Roumania. The population now
controlled by Prussian militarism is about
one hundred and seventy-five million
people. The economic resources controlled
by it show a corresponding increase.
Before the war began, Prussia planned for a
Pan-Germanism of this nature, and this
plan has now been almost completed.</p>

<p>If Prussia can now, by granting pretentious
but ineffective political reforms to
its own people and by fighting a defensive
war until the contest becomes a deadlock,
hold this Pan-Germany in its present position,
then after peace has been declared
it can organize this vast additional strength
in man power and resources which it has
gained, can Prussianize this additional
one hundred million, can, by the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
intrigue which it has used in the past,
undermine during this period of peace
the internal defensive effectiveness of the
democracies, and when the time comes
can strike again. And if the democracies
are unable to win now, what chance will
they have then?</p>

<p>Drop the scales from our eyes and look
clearly at the facts, hard as they are. The
Menace has been fighting a winning fight.
By merely keeping a deadlock for the rest
of the war, and forcing a truce under the
guise of peace, the Menace will win; provided,
however, that it is not expelled by
the German people themselves. This is
the strength&mdash;and the weakness&mdash;of the foe
against which we have declared war.</p>

<p>The Prussian looks a long way ahead.
M. Ch&eacute;radame, in his work, "Le Complot
Pan-Germaniste Demasqu&eacute;," recites the
following incident: "In 1898, before Manila,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the German Rear-Admiral von Goetzen,
a friend of the Kaiser, said to the
American Admiral Dewey, 'In about
fifteen years my country will begin a great
war.... Some months after we have
done our business in Europe we shall take
New York and probably Washington, and
we shall keep them for a time....
We shall extract one or two billions of
dollars from New York and other towns.'"
The months referred to by the German
sailor may be turned into years, and the
one or two billions may be multiplied by
ten&mdash;but the Prussian looks a long way
ahead.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> can our rights and the rights of
mankind to which the President has alluded
be made secure? What definite concrete
facts must be established in order that
democracy may be made safe?</p>

<p>In the first place, the autocratic power
that now puts terror into the heart of the
world must be broken beyond repair.
The Hohenzollerns and the rest of the
military caste which now controls Germany
must be politically exterminated.
No pretended or half-way internal political
reforms, leaving a road for their return
to power, will be sufficient. Annihilate
the Menace. The cancer must be cut out,
with no roots left in the body politic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to spread its hideous disease again. Make
an effective job of it once for all. We
want no chance, under the cloak of peace,
for the return of this monster.</p>

<p>"The time has come to conquer or submit,"
wrote President Wilson shortly
after our declaration of war. It is true.
Can any one doubt what would have
happened to the United States of America
if Prussian autocracy had dictated terms
of peace to vanquished Allies and as part
of those terms had taken over the allied
fleet and obtained territory in Canada?
Or can any one doubt what will now happen
to all the democracies if the present
Pan-Germany, now existing by means of
Prussian victories in this war, is during the
next ten years consolidated, organized,
Prussianized&mdash;and then, a fighting machine
twice as powerful as the machine of 1914,
hurled against the democracies? With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
an army of seven or eight million men
trained to the hour, with equipped reserves
of ten or twelve million more, with a complete
network of military railroads capable
of concentrating the units of this
engine of destruction wherever military
strategy shall designate, and with aeroplanes
and transatlantic submarines in
proportion, what chance will the democracies
have?</p>

<p>In the second place, it ought to be very
clear that future power and prosperity
on the part of the plain people of Germany
will be no bar to securing our rights, provided,
however, that this power and prosperity
is not owned and controlled by
Prussian autocracy so that it can again be
forced into a huge fighting machine to
put the rest of the world in terror. The
spirit of Lafayette, although its fight
against such masters is eternal, will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
lead in a war of conquest or annihilation
against the German people.</p>

<p>"We have no quarrel with the German
people," said the President of the United
States in his message of April 2, 1917.
"We have no feeling toward them but one
of sympathy and friendship. It was not
upon their impulse that their government
acted in entering this war. It was not
with their previous knowledge or approval.
It was a war determined upon as wars used
to be determined upon in the old, unhappy
days when peoples were nowhere consulted
by their rulers and wars were provoked
and waged in the interest of dynasties or
of little groups of ambitious men who were
accustomed to use their fellowmen as
pawns and tools." It was a war determined
upon by the same Menace that
thrust the democrat Lafayette into a
dungeon, and which so hated democracy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that when compelled to release him it
attempted to impose terms that he should
be deported to America, never again to
place foot on Prussian or Austrian soil.</p>

<p>The corollary of this is that the best
security for the rights of democracy is the
establishment of a republic in Germany.
A real republic, not a sham one. This is
the one definite, concrete fact which would
make the world safer for its peoples.</p>

<p>When will the German people see the
light? When will there be a government of
the people of Germany, for the people, and
by the people? The shades of her dead,
led to the slaughter by a merciless and
heartless autocracy in a needless war, cry
out for it. What say you, you men of
Germany? Among you are men whose
souls are brave and strong and true, an
unnumbered host. How long, slaves, will
you bend your backs to the lash of your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
military masters? They lied to you and
made you believe the Fatherland was attacked,
and led you, dupes, into a war of
conquest. Your modern Pilate, in his
blasphemous pride, with the name of God
upon his lips and the blood of innocents
upon his hands, is now crucifying Freedom
upon his cross of iron. But the day of the
resurrection will come; and how will your
record stand then? Awake, ye free of
Germany! When shall you come into
your own?</p>

<p>Every hour that the coming of such
a republic is shortened means just so
much less agony for the peoples of the
world. There is no better pledge for the
safety of democracy. "Self-governed nations,"
said the President of the United
States in the message referred to above,
"do not fill their neighbour states with
spies or set the course of intrigue to bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
about some critical posture of affairs which
will give them an opportunity to strike
and make conquest. Such designs can be
successfully worked out only under cover
and where no one has the right to ask
questions. Cunningly contrived plans of
deception or aggression, carried, it may be,
from generation to generation, can be
worked out and kept from the light only
within the privacy of courts or behind the
carefully guarded confidences of a narrow
and privileged class. They are happily
impossible where public opinion commands
and insists upon full information concerning
all the nation's affairs."</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> else? The union. The final act
in the world-wide drama of democracy.
The union of the democracies of the world
to insure mutual protection and peace. I
mean a union for this purpose of all
those governments where the people, by
their representatives, control. The union
on two hemispheres of what the spirit of
Lafayette foresaw, symbolized, and battled
for on both.</p>

<p>The union ought to include the Austrian
and German people themselves. It can
never, however, include the Prussian military
autocracy or any other military
autocracy. I quote again from the President's
message: "A steadfast concert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
for peace can never be maintained except
by a partnership of democratic nations.
No autocratic government could be trusted
to keep faith within it or observe its
covenants. It must be a league of honour,
a partnership of opinion. Intrigue would
eat its vitals away; the plottings of inner
circles who could plan what they would
and render account to no one would be a
corruption seated at its very heart. Only
free peoples can hold their purpose and
their honour steady to a common end and
prefer the interests of mankind to any
narrow interest of their own....
One of the things that has served to convince
us that the Prussian autocracy was
not and could never be our friend is that
from the very outset of the present war
it has filled our unsuspecting communities
and even our offices of government with
spies, and set criminal intrigues everywhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
afoot against our national unity of counsel,
our peace within and without, our industries,
and our commerce. Indeed it is now
evident that its spies were here even before
the war began; and it is unhappily not a
matter of conjecture, but a fact proved
in our courts of justice, that the intrigues
which have more than once come perilously
near to disturbing the peace and
dislocating the industries of the country
have been carried on at the instigation,
with the support, and even under the personal
direction of official agents of the
Imperial Government accredited to the
Government of the United States."</p>

<p>The union must be a union to keep the
future safe against war, a league to compel
every nation after the close of the present
war to settle any claim it may have against
its neighbour in the same way that individuals
settle their disputes&mdash;by rules of right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and reason instead of by the law of might.
It must be "some definite concert of power
that will make it virtually impossible that
any such catastrophe should ever overwhelm
us again." In a memorable address
to the Senate of the United States
on January 22, 1917, the President urged
that the United States enter into such a
league after the close of the present war, and
on the point of effectiveness said: "Mere
agreements may not make peace secure.
It will be absolutely necessary that a force
be created, as a guarantor of the permanency
of the settlement, so much greater
than the force of any nation now engaged
or any alliance hitherto formed or projected,
that no nation, no probable combination
of nations, could face or withstand
it. If the peace presently to be made is
to endure it must be a peace made secure
by the organized major force of mankind."</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI</h2>

<p>"<i>Cur non?</i>"&mdash;"Why not?" The union
of the democracies will be the culmination
of the world-wide drama begun by
the spirit of Lafayette.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, nineteen hundred years ago
in his Sermon on the Mount, said to the
wondering multitude: "For verily I say unto
you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law,
till all be fulfilled." Since then, as sure
and certain as the evolution of time itself,
the evolution of the law has been toward
such a union.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God's ways seem dark, but soon or late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They touch the shining hills of day;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Give ermined kings their hour of crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye have the future grand and great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The safe appeal of truth to time."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Year has followed year and century has
followed century, and through it all,
surely, slowly, often torn and twisted out
of shape but always growing, evolving,
moving onward, the law has followed the
safe appeal of truth to time, toward this
great goal. One jot or one tittle shall in
no wise pass from it till all be fulfilled. It
is the spirit of Lafayette that leads. It
was he who saw "the glory of the coming
of the Lord." He saw fulfilled in fact the
union of the separate democracies on one
hemisphere; his spirit sees the vision of
their union on two.</p>

<p>Gaze for a moment on what this soldier
spirit has looked down upon in the past and
on the vision of what it sees for the future.</p>

<p>Centuries ago individual man settled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
all his disputes with individual man by
fighting. It was the primitive method.
There was no law: might made right. The
spirit saw savage primeval force, unconquered,
untaught, powerful and brutal
in the wanton exercise of its strength.</p>

<p>Then, under the safe appeal of truth to
time, there gradually evolved, as between
man and man, the method of voluntary
submission to a judicial tribunal. Twisted
and gnarled was this growth however, for
even under Anglo-Saxon law the right of
trial by battle was jealously guarded, and
lasted for many years. A noble knight
charged with an offense could always demand
trial by battle; and if he succeeded in
running through the body or otherwise
disabling the man who made the accusation,
he thereby established his own innocence
and was acquitted by the court.
This also the spirit saw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Then gradually force was conquered,
tamed, and used; and there evolved the
modern court backed by the harnessed
force of the community&mdash;backed by force
sufficient to compel individual man to
settle his disputes in court instead of by
fighting, and if he refused and chose to
fight, sufficient to compel him to desist
and to punish him for his attempt. Force,
a human Niagara, wild from the beginning,
now controlled and directed by a higher
law. Imagine the modern courts of our
cities and states without the backing of
organized force&mdash;courts and judges and
rules of judicial procedure with no force to
support them, and each individual in the
community vested with the option in
case of a dispute with a neighbour to settle
that dispute by attacking the neighbour!
We should have anarchy within six months.</p>

<p>What about nations? What has the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
spirit seen there? For nations are merely
large collections of individuals. The same
law of evolution governs both.</p>

<p>The first and primitive method of settling
disputes between nations, and for a long
time the only one, was war; and this the
spirit beheld. Then gradually evolved
the method of voluntary submission to a
judicial tribunal such as the tribunal now
existing at The Hague, each nation retaining,
however, its right of trial by battle.
The next method, the vision of the future,
the new internationalism of which the
living Lafayette was the symbol, is the
harnessing of the united force of the peoples
of the world, the union of the democracies
to enforce the peace of the world. It is a
vision of the union to form a modern court
backed by force trained to obey the higher
law, backed by force sufficient to compel
nations to settle their disputes in court<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
instead of by fighting. It is a vision of the
war ogre, who has for centuries ravaged the
world, at last shackled and bound; of the
monster who with bloody claws and fangs
has torn, ripped, and murdered his victims
by the million, at last overcome; a vision
of this evil brute of war conquered, and of
primeval force trained, civilized, and forging
the chains to hold this devil of hell.</p>

for all time the independence of these
United States of America. The Civil War
settled for all time the question of slavery
in this hemisphere. This war must and
shall settle for all time the question of
military autocratic domination of the
world. "The time has come to conquer or
submit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>And if after we have checked and curbed
this natural foe to liberty there shall arise a
concert of the powers of the world, a
world-wide union to insure and enforce
future peace, a union based not merely on
treaty obligations which may be avoided,
or on a contract which may be broken,
but on a wide understanding and realization
that organized democracy must in the
future act concertedly as the police of the
world&mdash;then by just so much as we make
posterity safe, the awful sacrifice will not
have been made in vain.</p>

<p>We build for posterity. "<i>Cur non?</i>"&mdash;"Why
not?" It is the spirit of Lafayette
that calls. And with the call we hear
from the heavens the chant of a mighty
chorus, singing not the hymn of hate but
the p&aelig;an of peace on earth, good-will toward
men.</p>

<p>Those who do not know us gibe at us and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
throw our sins in our teeth. But this
mightiest of democracies is at last awakening,
is casting out the evil genii of opulence,
is girding on its sword for the great
work. Soldier of freedom, thou camest
to us in the time of our greatest need.
"Now," thou saidst, "is precisely the
moment to serve your cause." Symbol
of the united democracies of the world,
symbol of a union which will make the
earth safe for its peoples, symbol of a
union of peace, we are led by thy spirit.
We fight for democracy; we build for posterity.</p>
